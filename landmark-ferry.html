            <h2>About</h2>
            <p><strong>Built:</strong> The ferry started in 1817 with the Richmond Turnpike Company running service. Several mergers and sales later, the New York City government took control in 1905.</p>
            <p><strong>Today:</strong> Established in its modern form in the early 19th century, it remains one of the busiest ferry services in the U.S. today serving millions of passengeres a year. Beyond its transit function, the ferry ride has become a scenic experience for visitors looking for views of the harbor and the Statue of Liberty in the distance.</p>
