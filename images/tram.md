# Roosevelt Island Tramway

The Roosevelt Island Tramway is an aerial cable car that spans the East River, connecting Manhattan’s Upper East Side with Roosevelt Island.

## About

**Built:** Opened in May 1976, it was the first commuter aerial tramway in the U.S. and carries passengers roughly 3,140 ft above the river, offering unique skyline views.

**Today:** It is part of the MTA (MetroCards and OMNY are accepted), functioning as both a transit link and a tourist attraction. The four minute tram ride runs every 7.5–15 minutes between the Manhattan station at Second Avenue (59th–60th Street) and Roosevelt Island.
